# Repository settings

Same as [opentelemetry-java-instrumentation repository settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/contributing/repository-settings.md#repository-settings),
except that the branch protection rules for `v*` and `gh-pages` are not needed in this repository.
