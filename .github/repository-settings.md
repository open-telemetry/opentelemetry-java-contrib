# Repository settings

Same
as [opentelemetry-java-instrumentation repository settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/.github/repository-settings.md#repository-settings),
except that the rules for `gh-pages` and `cloudfoundry` branches are not relevant in this
repository.
