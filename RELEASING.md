# Versioning and releasing

OpenTelemetry Java Contrib uses [SemVer standard](https://semver.org) for versioning of its artifacts.

The version is specified in [version.gradle.kts](version.gradle.kts).

## Snapshot builds

Every successful CI build of the main branch automatically executes `./gradlew publishToSonatype`
as the last step, which publishes a snapshot build to
[Sonatype OSS snapshots repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/opentelemetry/contrib/).

## Preparing a new major or minor release

* Close the release milestone if there is one.
* Merge a pull request to `main` updating the `CHANGELOG.md`.
* Run the [Prepare release branch workflow](.github/workflows/prepare-release-branch.yml).
* Review and merge the two pull requests that it creates
  (one is targeted to the release branch and one is targeted to the `main` branch).

## Preparing a new patch release

All patch releases should include only bug-fixes, and must avoid adding/modifying the public APIs.

In general, patch releases are only made for regressions, memory leaks and deadlocks.

* Backport pull request(s) to the release branch
  * Run the [Backport workflow](.github/workflows/backport.yml).
  * Press the "Run workflow" button, then select the release branch from the dropdown list,
    e.g. `release/v1.9.x`, then enter the pull request number that you want to backport,
    then click the "Run workflow" button below that.
  * Review and merge the backport pull request that it generates
* Merge a pull request to the release branch updating the `CHANGELOG.md`
* Run the [Prepare patch release workflow](.github/workflows/prepare-patch-release.yml).
  * Press the "Run workflow" button, then select the release branch from the dropdown list,
    e.g. `release/v1.9.x`, and click the "Run workflow" button below that.
* Review and merge the pull request that it creates

## Making the release

Run the [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml).

* Press the "Run workflow" button, then select the release branch from the dropdown list,
  e.g. `release/v1.9.x`, and click the "Run workflow" button below that.
* This workflow will publish the artifacts to maven central and will publish a GitHub release with
  release notes based on the change log and with the javaagent jar attached.
* Lastly, if there were any change log updates in the release branch that need to be merged back to
  the main branch, the workflow will create a pull request if the updates can be cleanly applied,
  or it will fail this last step if the updates cannot be cleanly applied.
