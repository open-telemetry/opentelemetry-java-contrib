# JMX Metric Scraper

This utility provides a way to query JMX metrics and export them to an OTLP endpoint.
The JMX MBeans and their metrics mapping is defined in YAML.

This is currently experimental, but the end goal is to provide an alternative to the [jmx-metrics](../jmx-metrics/README.md) utility.
